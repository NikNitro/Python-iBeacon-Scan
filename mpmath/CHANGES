  mp2.cos(3)). Not all functions have been converted to context methods, and
  there are some bugs, so this feature is currently experimental.

* accuracy of cos and sin near roots has been fixed. computing
  sin(x) or cos(x) where x is huge is also much faster
* implemented a magical constant eps that gives the "machine"
  epsilon
* additional mathematical functions: implemented Catalan's constant
  and Bessel functions J_n(x) for integer n and real x
* new functions diff and diffc for numerical differentiation
* implemented the ldexp function for fast multiplication by 2**n
* mpf uses rich comparison methods (contributed by Pearu Peterson)
* epydoc-friendly docstrings (contributed by Pearu Peterson)
* support creating mpf from float nan or inf
* fixed printing of complex numbers with negative imaginary part
* flattened package structure to simplify inclusion of mpmath in other
  packages
* external classes can interoperate with mpf and mpc instances
  by defining _mpf_ or _mpc_ properties
* renamed lib.fpow -> lib.fpowi and implemented lib.fpow for general
  real powers. <mpf> ** <mpf> should now be slightly faster and more
  robust
* the internal number representation has been changed to include
  an explicit sign bit. as a result of this change and other small
  tweaks, arithmetic is up to 20% faster and the total running
  time for mpmath's unit tests has dropped 10%.
* miscellaneous speed improvements:
  * <mpf> ** <int> is 2-3 times faster (contributed by Mario Pernici)
  * <mpf> * <int> and <int> * <mpf> is roughly twice as fast
  * <int> / <mpf> is roughly twice as fast (contributed by Mario
    Pernici)
  * exp and log are about 10% faster
  * fast computation of e and exp(n) when precision is extremely high

Released January 13, 2008

* added the mpi type for interval arithmetic
* powers with integer exponents are computed with directed rounding
  all the way through to preserve interval bounds more robustly
  (however, the code is not fully tested and may have some bugs)
* string input to mpf.__new__() can now be unicode
* mpf.__eq__ now works in pypy
* infs and nans are now implemented in mpmath.lib, resulting in
  considerable simplification of the mpf class implementation
* partial support for infs and nans in functions, e.g.
  exp(inf) -> inf and exp(-inf) -> 0 now work.
* renamed several files. created mpmath.apps and moved tests into
  the main mpmath directory
* wrote script to permit running unit tests without py.test available
* improved bit counting code in fadd, fmul and fdiv, plus other
  small performance tweaks, resulting in a 20-30% speedup for
  arithmetic

Released November 24, 2007

* added the quad module for arbitrary-precision numerical integration
* floor and ceil functions available
* implemented __mod__ and __rmod__ for the mpf class
* partial support for the special numbers +inf, -inf and nan
* faster multiplication and division (up to 40% faster with psyco)
* simplified syntax for conversion function (from_int instead of
  from_int_exact, etc)
* renamed cgamma to euler
* more documentation strings

--0.4--
Released November 3, 2007

* new string conversion code (much faster; unlimited exponents)
* fixed bug in factorial (it gave the wrong value, though gamma worked)
* division now uses a rigorous algorithm for directed rounding
  (mpmath previously used a heuristic that got the last bit wrong
  in 1/10000 of cases)
* misc. performance improvements (arithmetic is 15% faster)
* refactored parts of the code; added many more docstrings and tests
* added a function rand() for generating full-precision random numbers
* rewrote the benchmark script to compare against Decimal and to
  automatically generate timings with psyco both disabled and enabled
* rewrote unit tests to use py.test

--0.3--
Released October 5, 2007

* fixed high-precision accuracy problem in complex sqrt
* fixed high-precision accuracy problem in atan and complex log
* fixed directed rounding for sqrt (always rounded to nearest)
* implemented all hyperbolic and inverse functions (there are some
  accuracy issues left to sort out)
* included gamma, factorial, erf, zeta incomplete gamma functions
* made sin and tan more accurate for complex input very close to 0
* more docstrings
* many more tests
* including a benchmark script
